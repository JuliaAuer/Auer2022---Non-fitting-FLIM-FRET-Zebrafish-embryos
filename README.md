# Auer2022---Non-fitting FLIM-FRET facilitates analysis of protein interactions in live Zebrafish embryos
The scripts are named as follows:
D1 = donor-intensity FRET (Fig 1C) + AAT-FRET (Fig 4) + AccPb (Fig 4, S1)
E3 = SE_FRET (Fig 1D)  + Donor Pb (Fig S1)
D3 = mfD AAT-FRET (Fig 5) + AccPb (Fig 5, S1)
